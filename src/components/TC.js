                            <p className="mb-2">To access most features of the Services, you are required to register and maintain an active personal account ("Account"). To create an Account, you must be at least 18 years old or meet the legal age of majority in your jurisdiction if it differs from 18.</p>
                            <p className="mb-2">During registration, you must provide RescueTap with certain personal details, including your name, address, mobile phone number, age, and at least one valid payment method (such as a credit card or an approved payment provider). You must ensure that all information associated with your Account is accurate, complete, and up to date at all times. Failure to do so—including having an expired or invalid payment method on file—may result in restricted access to the Services or the termination of your agreement with RescueTap.</p>
                            <p>You are solely responsible for all activities carried out through your Account and must maintain the confidentiality of your username and password. Unless explicitly permitted by RescueTap in writing, you are allowed to register for only one account.</p>

                            <p className="mb-2">At its sole discretion, RescueTap may allow you to submit, upload, publish, or share various forms of content through its Services. This may include text, audio, video, feedback, support requests, and entries for promotions or competitions ("User Content"). While you retain ownership of any User Content you provide, by submitting it to RescueTap, you grant the company a global, permanent, irrevocable, transferable, and royalty-free license—including the right to sublicense—to use, copy, modify, distribute, publicly display, create derivative works of, and otherwise utilize the content in any format or distribution channel, whether currently existing or developed in the future. This can include use on RescueTap's platforms, business operations, and third-party sites, without requiring further consent or compensation to you or any other party.</p>
                            <p className="mb-2">By submitting User Content, you confirm that:</p>

                                <li>Your content and its use by RescueTap do not violate any third-party rights, including intellectual property, privacy, publicity rights, or any applicable laws or regulations.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>You also agree not to submit content that is defamatory, obscene, violent, hateful, pornographic, unlawful, or otherwise offensive. RescueTap reserves the right—but is not obligated—to review, monitor, and remove any User Content at its discretion, without prior notice.</p>

                            <p className="mb-2">You are responsible for securing the necessary data network access to use RescueTap's Services. Your mobile carrier's data and messaging fees may apply when accessing the platform via a wireless-enabled device, and you bear sole responsibility for such costs.</p>
                            <p>Additionally, you must obtain and maintain compatible devices and hardware needed to use the Services and Applications, including any necessary updates. RescueTap does not guarantee that its Services will be compatible with all hardware or devices, and performance may be affected by internet connectivity issues or electronic communication disruptions.</p>

                            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Payment and Charges</h2>
                            <p className="mb-2">By using RescueTap's Services, you acknowledge that you may incur charges for goods or services provided by Third Party Providers ("Charges"). Once you receive these goods or services, RescueTap will process the payment on behalf of the Third Party Provider acting as their authorized payment collection agent. This means that your payment to RescueTap will be considered equivalent to a direct payment made to the Third Party Provider.</p>
                            <p className="mb-2">Charges may include additional fees, such as booking private/personal doctors, and any applicable taxes as required by law. Unless otherwise determined by RescueTap, all payments made are final and non-refundable. However, you retain the right to negotiate a lower charge directly with the Third Party Provider at the time of service. If a Third Party Provider requests a price adjustment, RescueTap will consider the request accordingly.</p>

                            <p className="mb-2">RescueTap reserves the right to modify, add, or remove Charges for any of its Services or Goods at its sole discretion. You also understand that in certain geographical locations or periods of high demand, Charges may significantly increase. While RescueTap will make reasonable efforts to inform you of applicable Charges, you are responsible for all costs incurred under your Account, whether or not you were explicitly aware of them.</p>
                            <p className="mb-2">Occasionally, RescueTap may offer promotional discounts or special pricing to certain users, leading to varying Charges for similar services. You acknowledge that such promotions or discounts are independent of your Charges and do not entitle you to similar pricing unless explicitly offered to you. Additionally, if you choose to cancel a service request before the Third Party Provider arrives, a cancellation fee may apply.</p>

                            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Gratuities and User Feedback</h2>
                            <p className="mb-2">The payment structure is designed to fully compensate the Third Party Provider for their services or goods. Unless stated otherwise for specific transportation services, RescueTap does not designate any portion of your payment as a tip or gratuity. Any statements by RescueTap indicating that tipping is "optional," "not required," or "included" do not imply that additional amounts are paid to the Third Party Provider beyond the stated charges.</p>
                            <p className="mb-2">You are free to provide a gratuity at your discretion, but it is completely voluntary. Once you have received a service or product through the RescueTap platform, you will also have the opportunity to rate your experience and provide feedback regarding the third-party Provider.</p>

                            <p className="mb-2">If a dispute remains unresolved within sixty (60) days after a request for <strong>mediation</strong> has been submitted under the ICC mediation rules, the matter may be referred to arbitration in accordance with the rules of arbitration of the international chamber of commerce ("ICC arbitration rules").
